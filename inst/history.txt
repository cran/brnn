version 0.1 (2012-12-23):
  Initial version
version 0.2 (2013-03-05):
  Many improvements, 
version 0.4 (2014-12-03)
  Fixes so that it compiles without problems in new R versions
version 0.5 (2015-01-07)
  Makefile changes so that it compiles without problems in new R versions
version 0.6 (2016-01-26)
  Very small fixes in C source code, replace SUPPORT_OPENMP with _OPENMP
version 0.7 (2018-08-23)
   Native routine registration   
version 0.8 (2020-01-04)
  Added support for ordinal responses
version 0.9 (2021-09-09)
  Very small fixed in C source code to fix compilation problems with clang13.0.0. The inclusion of openmp headers
  causes a compilation error if included after Rinternal.h"
version 0.9.1 (2022-04-24)
  Fixes to call correctly BLAS/LAPACK routines. USE_FC_LEN_T will become the default: this uses the correct
  prototypes for Fortran BLAS/LAPACK routines called from C/C++, and requires adjustment of most such 
  calls - see "Writing R Extensions" 6.6.2.  (This has been supported since R 3.6.2.)
